Connect Four is a classic two-player strategy game where players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertical grid. The goal of the game is to connect four of your colored discs in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally while preventing your opponent from doing the same. The game ends when a player successfully connects four of their pieces, or when the board is completely filled with discs and no player has won. Connect Four is a simple yet challenging game that can be enjoyed by players of all ages.
