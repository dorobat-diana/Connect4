Overview:

Connect Four is a classic two-player board game that requires strategic thinking and tactical planning. This Python project aims to create a versatile and engaging version of Connect Four by implementing multiple computer opponents, each with its unique gameplay strategy. The game offers both a graphical user interface (GUI) for a visually appealing experience and a console-based UI for those who prefer a more traditional interface.

Project Features:

Multiple Computer Opponents:

Logical Strategy Opponent: This AI opponent uses a rule-based approach, focusing on attacking the player's positions and blocking their moves effectively. It evaluates the current game state to make decisions.

Numerical Scale Strategy Opponent: This AI opponent assigns a numerical score to each possible move and selects the move with the highest score. The scoring system is designed to prioritize moves that are likely to lead to a win or block the opponent's victory.

Minimax Strategy with Pruning: The project incorporates a sophisticated AI opponent that employs the Minimax algorithm combined with pruning techniques. This AI explores the game tree, considering both the player's and opponent's moves, to make optimal decisions while minimizing computation time.

Graphical User Interface (GUI):

The GUI provides an intuitive and visually appealing way to play Connect Four. Players can make moves by clicking on the desired column, and the board updates in real-time.

Console-Based User Interface:

For users who prefer a text-based interface, the project includes a console-based UI. Players can make moves by entering column numbers, and the game state is displayed using text-based graphics.
Winning Condition and Game Logic:

The game follows the traditional Connect Four rules, where the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs wins the game.

Why This Project Matters:

This project showcases the versatility of Python in implementing different AI strategies and interfaces.

It offers an excellent opportunity for AI enthusiasts to explore various AI algorithms, from simple rule-based strategies to more advanced techniques like Minimax with pruning.

It provides a fun and educational way for users to improve their strategic thinking and problem-solving skills.

The inclusion of both GUI and console-based UI ensures accessibility to a wide range of users, catering to different preferences.
